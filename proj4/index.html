    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>Please Read Instructions before playing.</p>
	<p>Press Enter to Advance or initate dialogue.</p>
    <p>In battle, use W to move the pointer up and S to move the pointer down. Press ENTER to make a selection.</p>
    <p>Some enemies are faster than you so they will finish their action before you do.<p>
    <p>All enemies have a small chance to miss their attacks against you.<p>
    <p>All enemies will make the player stronger in some way, even if the changes arent readily apparent.<p>
    <p>The SKILL option in combat temporarily doubles your attack power but costs a small amount of health on each attack. It only works once, so spamming it is useless.</p>
    <p>There are NPCs in each town that will heal the player.</p>
    <p>The player has been blessed by the goddess of plenty, use HEAL in combat will restore health up to the current armor level. (no limit)</p>
    <p>Looking for a challenge? Try and beat the game by defeating as few enemies as possible.</p>
    <p>WARNING: If you attempt to run from any bosses, then the Shadow King will win and the world will be consumed by darkness. This includes enemies that block progression.</p>
